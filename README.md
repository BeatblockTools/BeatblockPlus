## Beatblock Plus
Beatblock Plus offers an in-game mod menu for players and utilities for developers.  
Currently, it doesn't offer much but there will be many updates in the future.  

## How to Install

**1)** Install [lovely-injector](<https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector/releases/latest>), we will use this to inject our mods to the game. You probably used this if you modded Balatro before.  
**2)** In Steam, right-click Beatblock and click "Properties -> Installed Files -> Browse" to open the game's installation folder.  
**3)** Copy the `version.dll` file inside lovely-injector to your game directory.  
**4)** Open the game, if a terminal opens with the game that means you've successfully downloaded the injector.
